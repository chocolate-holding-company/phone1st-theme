# Welcome to Phone1st

## A light, clean, starter theme that starts... _phone1st_

![](tile-wide.png)

> A light and basic html starter theme to get you off to a quick start with your web developments. The CSS is put together using SCSS, a popular way of creating quick, organised stylesheets. Using Phone1st will save you time, building quicker, smarter projects. Once you start using Phone1st you'll keep using it.

### Quick Start

**Download** - **Rename the folder** - **Import into CodeKit**

Alter/Remove **google analylitics** - includes/\_scripts.kit

Build your site with the help of the **test folder**

Remove the **test folder**

Upload the **build folder** to your server

---

### CodeKit

Phone1st is designed to be used with [CodeKit](https://codekitapp.com/) (_Mac only_). Taking advantage of _CodeKits_ - _kit_ templates and _kit_ variables.

If you don't have _CodeKit_ the _css_ folder and _scss_ files may be adapted to suit your use. You'll need a Scss processor to parse the _scss_. The _Css_ style-sheet in the _build_ folder isn't minified and measures just over 800 lines.

The theme should build correctly when imported into Codekit, but if not:

_You can delete the **build** folder and **re-build**._

_Remove the **config.codekit3** file and re-import into **CodeKit** using your CodeKit settings_

_You can set the paths to suit yourself but phone1st uses:_

- style.scss - /build/css/style.css
- app.js - /build/js/app.js
- images - /build/images/
- index.kit - /build/index.html

To view the _test folder pages_

- test.kit - /build/test/test.html
- about.kit - /build/test/about.html
- scss.kit - /build/test/scss.html
- class.kit - /build/test/class.html
- page.scss - /build/test/css/page.css
- test.scss - /build/test/css/test.css

- all test images to /build/test/test-images/

---

### The Test Folder

The _test_ folder can be removed when no longer required it will not effect the theme.

#### Test Page

Use the _test_ page to set the basic elements.

#### Scss Mixins Page

Default mixins used with the _Phone1st_ theme.

#### Class Page

**Work in progress** - a class utilities page built around the theme variables - _experimental_.

### Basic SEO

The following _variables_ for Meta Data are available with some _Facebook_ and _Twitter_ meta. These are optional and you should add or subtract what you require.

Meta variables:

    <!-- $title Page Title --> - //Basic page title for use with navigation etc. eg _Home, About, etc

    <!-- $SEO-title A Longer Title--> - //A more descriptive title - 60ish characters

    <!-- $description Page Description --> - //120ish characters

    <!-- $keyword Home, About --> - //word or words

    <!-- $url index.html --> - //exact url - canonical

    <!-- $post-image eg tile-wide.png --> - //image to use for Facebook and Twitter meta image

See _includes/\_meta.kit_.

**Important** - Check the meta data in your _page head_ with the browser inspector

---

### Experimenting with Classes

Experimenting with the class _utitlity_ method for styling. I think the more complicated classes with quite a number of styles are still easier using conventional styles or stylesheet. Utitlity classes seem to work well with template structures ensuring consistant styles potentially leading to faster development and execution times. _Will have to see how it goes and see what evolves_.
