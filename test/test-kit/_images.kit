  I liked <strong>Agra</strong>, not the city, but the area around the
  <strong>Taj Mahal</strong>. <strong>Agra city</strong> is a typical Indian
  city, <em>chaotic, big</em> and <em>busy</em>. It's still chaotic around the
  <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> but there are some cheap hotels and cheap places to
  eat. You can relax on the roof top restaurants with the
  <strong>Taj Mahal</strong> shimmering in the background. I was staying at a
  hotel 1.5 km back towards the city. About 200 metres from the hotel were I was
  staying there was a <em>'Pizza Hut'</em>, I tried it and I had one of the best
  meals I have had in <strong>India</strong>. Their pizza's were lovely and
  crispy served with crisp salad and fries.
</p>
<p>
  The Tuk Tuk's were out in force hassling as were the Rickshaw's, it's hard to
  get rid of them. I got one to the <strong>Taj</strong> and when he insisted on
  waiting I insisted he didn't. The <strong>Taj</strong> looked like a ghost,
  the effect of the sun shinning on it's white marble. It glistened in a hazy
  mist of pollution which gave it a mirage effect. The charge for tourists was
  <em>750 rupees</em> for Indians it's a fraction of this price. There were a
  lot of souvenir sellers and guides hassling the tourists and some will even
  take pictures of you against the <strong>Taj</strong> background for a price
  of course. After the <strong>Taj</strong> I visited
  <strong>Agra Fort</strong>, the outside looked impressive but inside was a bit
  of a let down. It cost <em>250 rupees</em> but if your not really into ruins,
  then going into the fort is a waste of time. But it was nice at the end of the
  day to go to a restaurant by the <strong>Taj</strong>
  <cite>'Lonely Planet recommended' </cite>according to the signs and relax away
  from the crowds.

  Getting out of <strong>Agra</strong> was hard. It was
  <em>misty, smelly</em> and <em>big</em>. I had to keep asking the way as I was
  following a secondary road to <strong>Bharatpur</strong>.
  <strong>Bharatpur</strong> was only <em>40 miles</em> away and from what I had
  read has a pretty impressive bird sanctuary. On the way I passed
  <strong>Fatehpur Sikri</strong>, which had a very impressive looking temple
  but I decided against going inside. On reaching <strong>Bharatpur</strong> I
  found a hotel at the end of town, I was drawn to it because of it's very
  colourful garden. It was cheap and clean and did a good breakfast, very
  relaxing after the big towns. There is a main town which is quite big and busy
  like any other Indian town, the good thing was it was <em>2km</em> away.
</p>
<p>
  The bird sanctuary cost <em>200 rupees</em> plus <em>25 rupees</em> for the
  bike. The main entrance ticket was small and came from a machine. The entrance
  ticket for the bike was A5 size and filled in by hand, it took ten times
  longer to issue the bike ticket just for the extra <em>25 rupees</em>. After
  passing the gauntlet of guides and rickshaw cycles I entered the park. A
  tarmac road takes you through the centre of the park for about
  <em>6km</em> with trees and what should have been marsh land on either side.
  There was a lack of water due to climate change which is affecting the
  monsoons. As a result there was a lack of birds and a lack of tourists.
  <strong>Bharatpur</strong> is really struggling for tourists, it should be
  booked solid with bird watchers but there were none.

  There were a few waders and other smaller birds, even owls and birds of prey
  along the banks of the few small ponds. In the ponds you could see turtles
  with very long necks and some ugly cat fish, but the water looked murky, like
  something out of <em>Murdor</em>, <cite>'Lord Of The Rings'</cite>, thick with
  mud. There were bridle tracks leading off the main tarmac road. These roads
  went for miles into the parks remote areas. I ended up doing about
  <em>20 miles</em> in the park on the first day. There wasn't much more
  wildlife in the remote areas but I did surprise a few big lizards basking in
  the sun. The park had a wall going round the perimeter with a few small
  villages scattered along the edges. The people from the villages worked in the
  park clearing reeds, it seemed like the women did the work while the men sat
  and watched from the shade. I stayed at <strong>Bharatpur</strong> for two
  days and went in the park again on the second day. As I cycled up the tarmac
  road I could hear the rickshaw drivers/guides point out to the few tourists
  the same owls and same birds in distant trees, and when I looked they did look
  the same as the previous day. I began to think maybe they were nailed in
  position. At the end of the tarmac road I met another cyclist touring
  <em>India</em>, but he was going in the opposite direction, heading for
  <strong>Agra</strong>. He was carrying camping equipment and tried to camp
  where possible. He camped far from the towns and made sure there were no
  people around. He then went into the fields and tried to hide his position
  from the road. But within <em>15 minutes</em> of pitching the tent a head
  popped inside the tent <em>"hello how are you?".</em> Soon after a crowd
  gathered and he soon found out why camping wasn't popular in <em>India</em>.

  <strong>Tonk</strong> seems to be an up and coming town with lots of building
  going on. I didn't see much of the town as the hotel was on the highway about
  <em>3km</em> away. It seemed a bit weird, the hotel built on baron land with a
  bit of a pond next to it was very isolated. The nearest building looked to be
  about a kilometre away. On a stroll to the local
  <em>Hero Honda shop</em> which was on the edge of town, I learned that I could
  have purchased a brand new <em>Hero Honda</em> for
  <em>38,000 Rupee (about 500 Pounds)</em>, the same price as my bike. No wonder
  the Indians look at me as if I am mad, why would a westerner with supposedly
  lots of money want to cycle in India when an Indian with not so much money can
  afford a motorcycle and there are thousands of these <em>Hero Hondas</em> on
  the road.

  It was another easy ride to <strong>Sawai Madopur</strong> along a quiet
  secondary road, with fields of various vegetables on either side. I stayed at
  <strong>Sawai Madopur</strong> for two days and went to see the tigers in the
  park on the second day. I would recommend a visit to
  <em>Ranthambore National Park</em> early in the morning <em>6.30 am</em>. I
  paid <em>550 Rupees</em> for a seat on the tourist jeep which looked like an
  old army wagon that seated about <em>15</em> people. The park was about
  <em>12km</em> away, we picked up people from various isolated hotels on the
  way. It took about an hour to reach the park which was in the mountains. It
  was quite cold, we were wrapped up in blankets and I wore a fleece top for the
  first time since arriving in India. There were five or six tourist jeeps and a
  few smaller jeeps all full with people, camera ready to spot the tiger. It
  wasn't long before one came into view, the chase was on, all the jeeps headed
  for the tiger, wheels bouncing over the rough tracks trying to get the best
  position. The tiger although still quite far away didn't seem to mind the
  commotion of vehicles and carried on walking slowly and casually until it went
  out of view into the reed bed. Spotted deer, monkeys and many birds could be
  seen as the vehicles made there way through the rugged landscape searching for
  more tigers.

  We stopped by a lake where there were plenty of birds, a couple of crocodiles
  could be seen, they looked like logs drifting in the water. Another tiger came
  into view and the chase was on again. This time the tiger was a lot closer and
  posed for some very good pictures. It wasn't concerned with the commotion and
  stayed in view walking along the edge of the reed bed. It then disappeared
  into the reed bed and we heard the cry of a young deer. The tiger had caught
  the deer and seemed to be playing with it's victim as cats do. The adult deers
  and the monkeys were making very loud cries as if to try and frighten the
  tiger into letting it's prey go. Although we couldn't see what was happening
  we could hear the young deer cry and the tiger growl for what seemed to go on
  for a long time. Even though I had seen this before on wildlife programmes
  seeing it live was both sad and thrilling. The safari lasted about
  <em>4 hours</em> and was worth the money and the tip of about a
  <em>100 rupee</em> off each person to the guides/driver. They don't guarantee
  a tiger sighting but if you go in the morning you stand a better chance,
  <dfn>(they do morning and afternoon trips)</dfn>. I would not miss
  <em>Ranthambore National Park</em> if you're in the area.

  <mark><em>These two images have the class="img-framed".</em></mark> The next
  day I cycled to <strong>Jaipur</strong>. The ride was easy, very flat but I
  still arrived a little late, it was dark when I reached the outskirts of the
  city. I had looked for a hotel in <strong>Deuce</strong> a town
  <em>51km</em> before <strong>Jaipur</strong>, but the one I looked at was very
  scruffy and a bit overpriced. Staying at this hotel was another cyclist, he
  was cycling from the east coast to the west coast. If I hadn’t have spent time
  in <strong>Deuce</strong> I would have made Jaipur in the light and would have
  seen some buildings that seem to have been cut into the rock on a hilly road
  into the city.

  These buildings looked impressive, even though I couldn't fully see them in
  the dark, and I got quite excited about <strong>Jaipur</strong>. Maybe I had
  come to a city that wasn't a clone of <strong>Delhi</strong>, that had these
  impressive old buildings. When I got to the city centre I was to be
  disappointed again. From the hotel, the palace and other tourist attractions
  were about <em>2km</em>. They were interesting and a nice colour of pink and
  very crowded. I could have reached
  <strong>Sawai Madopur, Ranthambore National Park</strong> a day earlier by
  using the secondary road from <strong>Bharatpur</strong>. Instead from
  <strong>Jaipur</strong> I cycled to <strong>Tonk</strong> on the national
  highway.
